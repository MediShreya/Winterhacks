It is important that you nurture your child's spirituality by adding the religious significance 
to Christmas celebration. Teach your child that Christmas is
not just about gifts, it's also a time for prayer.</p>
<p style="font-size:25px;">Teaching children the value of prayer, especially on Christmas, is essential in letting 
them know and appreciate the important principles of the holiday, which is the birth of Jesus Christ
 and being thankful for the things provided to us. Kids all too often associate Christmas with
 presents,Santa Claus, and other symbolic things, and forget what really matters–Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p style="font-size:25px;">
Christmas prayers for children are important because it teaches them that being thankful goes far beyond Thanksgiving or any holiday. Prayers extend to the heights of the heavens. 

Whether they decide to write their own prayer, use another’s, or even say a silent prayer, they would surely be heard by at least one person.
</p>
<h1>Here are a few Prayers for kids:</h1>

Dear Father in Heaven,

Thank You for giving us the gift of Jesus, the greatest Christmas gift of all. 
Please help me to remember why we celebrate, even as we eat Christmas cookies and open presents.
 I am very thankful for the real reason for the season and, without Jesus, we wouldn’t have
 Christmas! I love You and thank You for giving us this day!

Dear Jesus,

I know I’m very blessed today, spending time with my family, having a yummy dinner, and getting to open presents, but I know there are many people who won’t get those things today. Please send them lots of blessings, and let them know that someone is thinking about them on Christmas. Help me see how I can bless other people, too!
